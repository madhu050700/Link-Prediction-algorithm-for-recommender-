# Link-Prediction-algorithm-for-recommender-system

Here, “Citations” network dataset for link prediction. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) shows that the datahas three nodes: venue, articles, and authors, and found that 99%ariticles have eight citations or less; on the other hand, 99%articles cite six or fewer other articles.

Three link prediction algorithms (common neighbours, preferential attachments, and total neighbours) were implemented, and the results show that common neighbour has the most promising performance in predicting the links.
